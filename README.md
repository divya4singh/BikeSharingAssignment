# Bike Sharing Assignment
> A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

## General Information
- Build a linear regression model to find the variables which have a significant impact on the demand for shared bikes.
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
Understand which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes & how well those variables describe the bike demands
- What is the dataset that is being used?

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- We can see that temperature variable is having the highest coefficient 0.3188, which means if the temperature increases by one unit the number of bike rentals increases by 0.3188 units.
- With the increase in year we see more rentals. As in the dataset we saw a growth in rentals from 2018 to 2019.
